<h1>Brief Introduction and Background</h1>

<p>
My name is Dan Cigler and I am a Type1 Diabetic completing this course to fill in the gaps in my knowledge of Ruby on Rails. I am building a 
glucose trend identifier tool to help manage my diabetes. I am self-taught with the help of a developer friend guiding me along during key steps 
of learning and struggles. 

Instagram > @dancigler, @fullstkdiabetic for information on myself and my diabetes management app.

Thank you!
